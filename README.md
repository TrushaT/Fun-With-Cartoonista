# Fun With Cartoonista!
Convert your image into a cartoon with just a click!

## Inspiration
As we know data is all around us and is an integral part of our day-to-day lives. People nowadays are very active on social media and use it for various purposes such as better reach, entertainment, communication, social image and many more. The "socially-active" person loves to send and receive photographs of himself/herself and loves experimenting with them. He/She uses filters to modify the look and feel of the pictures! We have taken this opportunity to create a filter that converts a photograph of a person/animal/scenery etc. into a "cartoonized" version! 

## What it does
We allow the user to upload a picture of his/her choice and convert the picture into a cartoon. This converted picture can be downloaded and shared on other platforms. This gives users a platform to share different memories and experiences in the form of cartoons!

## How we built it
We used OpenCV Python for processing the image and converting it to a cartoon form. The backend is handled by Django and for the frontend Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML and CSS have been used.

## Challenges we ran into
Both of us were beginners in Django and Computer Vision. It was very difficult to upload and save images using Django. The integration of OpenCV and Django seemed difficult at first! 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created something fun and implemented a unique blend of computer vision and entertainment. We got to learn many new things during this journey.

## What we learned
We learned to integrate OpenCV and Django. We learned to use time judiciously and have fun with coding!

## What's next for Fun with Cartoonista !
Users will have the opportunity to upload their fun-filled memories for other users to view using personalised user accounts.
